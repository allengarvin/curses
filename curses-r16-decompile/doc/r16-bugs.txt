Giving anything to Joshua Meldew stops the daemon:

    if( action == ##Give or ##ThrowAt ) {
        remove noun;
        StopDaemon(self);
        if( noun == chicken_wishbone ) {
            move iron_key to Priest_s_Hole;
            give iron_key general;
            remove Sir_Joshua_Meldrewe;
            Achieved(SCORE_JOSHUA);
            "The ghost swallows the wishbone, grinning nastily. Then a look of consternation spreads across his face. He begins to choke and as he fades away, his arms flailing wildly, he lets go of the key, which sails through the air onto the roof and (against all odds) falls neatly down a chimney.";
        }
        print "The ghost swallows ";
        Defart(noun);
        " whole and grins!";
    }

So you can give him something useless, and take your leisure

>get key
As you reach for the key, a swirling mist condenses about it, into a ghostly head which opens its mouth and eats up the key!  The rest of the ghostly body
solidifies about the head and rises to swagger before you.

The ghost laughs in a gurgling kind of way, as it were always coughing and spluttering.

>give crumpled paper to ghost
The ghost swallows the crumpled piece of paper whole and grins!

The coal bunker has routines for locking and unlocking, but has no 'with_key' property. Thus, it can never be unlocked.

Object  -> coal_bunker "coal bunker"
  with  name 'coal' 'bunker' 'loading' 'door',
        after [;

Does the torch ever go out?

The daemon checks:
    if( self hasnt on ) {
        rfalse;
    }

but it's not turned on/off. It has light only

Ah, you can't get into the cupboard without changing it out, but it will never go out

Click!  The timer runs out, but the bomb was disarmed. You pocket the timer and hide the rest of the evidence under the table.

The clock is ticking downwards, and is right on the red zone!  None of the wires are plugged in.

The timer seems quite simple to set. The clock is ticking downwards, and is right on the red zone!  None of the wires are plugged in.

Because the smooth_round_stone has its "moved" attribute removed:
        move smooth_round_stone to Warehouses_and_Port;
        move rusty_iron_key to Warehouses_and_Port;
        give smooth_round_stone ~general;
        give smooth_round_stone ~moved;
        give smooth_round_stone ~concealed;
        give rusty_iron_key general;
        rusty_iron_key.initial = "That iron key seems to have washed up here...";

it is scored twice in the "things_scored". Thus you can win the game with 554 points.

You can ask Evans for the mascot multiple times

Waving the green branch when you're wearing the gas mask still makes you sneeze.

>don gas
After a brief ecstasy of fumbling, you pull it on. It smells unpleasantly of World War II leftover cork.

>wave green
The pollen given off makes you sneeze a little, but fails to give you the bird. (Worth a try, anyway.)


Suggested text if you're wearing the gas mask, and either aren't at Hollow or have already scared away the corn crake:
"The branch releases a small cloud of pollen, but fails to give you the bird. (Worth a try, anyway.)"
or maybe:
"You look ridiculous waving the green branch."
---------------------------------------------------------------
Sensibly, you're unable to eat the cake of carbolic soap while wearing the gas mask. But it doesn't prevent you from washing your mouth with soap.

>don gas
After a brief ecstasy of fumbling, you pull it on. It smells unpleasantly of World War II leftover cork.

>damn
Now, that sort of language is an absolute disgrace, and you're going to have to pay the price for it.

>eat soap
Not with a gas mask on!

>wash mouth with soap
Ugh, it tastes absolutely ghastly. But you feel better for it.

---------------------------------------------------------------
If you sleep in Alison's Writing Room with the gas mask on, and then curse while in the dream, you're unable to eat the soap, even though "inventory"
doesn't show the gas mask being worn (and thus it can't be removed). If you don't know that you can also make amends for cursing by "wash mouth with soap",
you'll be unable to complete the dream sequence.

>don gas
After a brief ecstasy of fumbling, you pull it on. It smells unpleasantly of World War II leftover cork.

>go bed
You get onto the comfortable bed.

On the comfortable bed you can see a flag of the British Merchant Navy.

>sleep
You sleep uneasily, fancying you can see Miss Alison writing at her table, trying to see the words, and always on the edge of a...

Melancholy Dream
A strangely familiar, dusty passage, sloping down from a southern end bathed in hostile light to some kind of metal barrier in the north.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>sod
Now, that sort of language is an absolute disgrace, and you're going to have to pay the price for it.

A ghostly apparition of a venerable man hazes into view. He raises his mahogany staff and strikes it (silently) on the ground, then points it at the walls,
and suddenly a flurry of green luminescence chases around you!

He fades away again, mumbling something incoherent.

>e
You're going nowhere until you make amends for that nasty bad language.

>eat soap
Not with a gas mask on!

>doff gas
You can't see any such thing.

>i
You are carrying:
  a cake of carbolic soap

>wash mouth with soap
Ugh, it tastes absolutely ghastly. But you feel better for it.

Solid Sand
Your ghostly self is embedded in a diagonal downward shaft (descending to the east) entirely filled with dry sand. Solid flagstones line the walls.

If you have taken the model of an animal so ugly you can't bear to look at it, the monkey gains life when you look in Alison's mirror even if you're no
longer holding it, i.e. even if you've dropped or destroyed that object somewhere else. This happens every time you subsequently look in that mirror, even
if the monkey has already been awakened, as long as you have at least one object in your inventory which the mirror shows (i.e. any object if you've
polished the mirror, or any non-rod object if you haven't), and even if you've already seen the monkey on Evans.

>x mirror
In the mirror is one of the most strikingly attractive people you have ever seen in all your born days, carrying an electric torch.

Now that you have finally been able to look it in the eyes, the monkey leaps from your arms, revelling in its new life, and scampers away through the
windows onto the balcony, then up and over the side of the house. You can just make it out as it races down the footpath.

The game allows you to refer to the contents of the tubes in the pigeonhole after the messenger-boy places them there, before you have even examined them.

>x pigeonhole
A depository for scrolls.

>l in pigeonhole
The pigeonhole is empty.

>x scroll
A lamentably naff tourist's gift, this seems to be a "replica" of one of the papyri on which some lost Greek play or other was written. Some nonsense about
the priestess of Apollo being summoned by music, etcetera.

It has all the charm of a tea-towel of, oh, say the Taj Mahal made out of curry.

A messenger-boy in a plain white tunic slips into the library and places a couple of tubes in the pigeonhole. So resentful is he of missing the party
outside that he fails to notice you, and runs back out again at once.

>put scroll in pigeonhole
You need to be holding it before you can put it into something else.

>take scroll
Which do you mean, a scroll bearing a short poem or the ragged scroll?

---------------------------------------------------------------
If both the epic and short poem scrolls are available, the game only lists one of them in its disambiguation list when you refer to a scroll.

>i
You are carrying:
  a ragged scroll
  a scroll bearing a short poem
  a scroll bearing an epic poem

>x scroll
Which do you mean, the ragged scroll or a scroll bearing a short poem?

The description of Roman Villa doesn't tell you the door is south, and it doesn't let you even refer to "door" as a noun.

Roman Villa
You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut
off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil
war, and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing. From here you could cut across the hillside east to west, or slip in through a
none-too-secure timber door.

>enter door
That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

Atrium Cloister

Typos

"A plain but cheery taverna, fill of miserable and rather ashamed men who are drinking retsina heavily. The day is dawning outside the north door, but they strangely do not share your uplifted feeling at the sight."
"fill" should be "full".

"For even he has not life force enough to hold together in the mists: his skeleton begins to clatter away to nothing, falling in all directions, his heart, hand and skull returning Somehow to your feet. And they are altering, altering even as you look down into the void..."
"Somehow" should not be capitalized.

"The air charges with excitement, and the symbol glows fiercely gold, then begins to spin, faster and faster into a pearly golden light with bathes you with the flow of pure magic. "
"with" should be "which".

"Whatever function this spacious room once had, now it is evidently home to military men, for it is filled with crude armour, spears, rough blankets which are little more than animal hides. Fortunately for you the guards are absent."
There should be an "and" between "spears," and "rough blankets".
